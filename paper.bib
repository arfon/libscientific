    abstract={Abstract The Lohm{\"o}ller?Wold decomposition of multi-way (three-way, four-way, etc.) data arrays is combined with the non-linear partial least squares (NIPALS) algorithms to provide multi-way solutions of principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least squares modelling in latent variables (PLS). The decomposition of a multi-way array is developed as the product of a score vector and a loading array, where the score vectors have the same properties as those of ordinary two-way PCA and PLS. In image analysis, the array would instead be decomposed as the product of a loading vector and an image score matrix. The resulting methods are equivalent to the method of unfolding a multi-way array to a two-way matrix followed by ordinary PCA or PLS analysis. This automatically proves the eigenvector and least squares properties of the multi-way PCA and PLS methods. The methodology is presented; the algorithms are outlined and illustrated with a small chemical example.},

    abstract = {Abstract Multiblock and hierarchical PCA and PLS methods have been proposed in the recent literature in order to improve the interpretability of multivariate models. They have been used in cases where the number of variables is large and additional information is available for blocking the variables into conceptually meaningful blocks. In this paper we compare these methods from a theoretical or algorithmic viewpoint using a common notation and illustrate their differences with several case studies. Undesirable properties of some of these methods, such as convergence problems or loss of data information due to deflation procedures, are pointed out and corrected where possible. It is shown that the objective function of the hierarchical PCA and hierarchical PLS methods is not clear and the corresponding algorithms may converge to different solutions depending on the initial guess of the super score. It is also shown that the results of consensus PCA (CPCA) and multiblock PLS (MBPLS) can be calculated from the standard PCA and PLS methods when the same variable scalings are applied for these methods. The standard PCA and PLS methods require less computation and give better estimation of the scores in the case of missing data. It is therefore recommended that in cases where the variables can be separated into meaningful blocks, the standard PCA and PLS methods be used to build the models and then the weights and loadings of the individual blocks and super block and the percentage variation explained in each block be calculated from the results. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The untargeted profiling of steroids constitutes a growing research field because of their importance as biomarkers of endocrine disruption. New technologies in analytical chemistry, such as ultra high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), offer the possibility of a fast and sensitive analysis. Nevertheless, difficulties regarding steroid identification are encountered when considering isotopomeric steroids. Thus, the use of retention times is of great help for the unambiguous identification of steroids. In this context, starting from the linear solvent strength (LSS) theory, quantitative structure retention relationship (QSRR) models, based on a dataset composed of 91 endogenous steroids and VolSurf + descriptors combined with a new dedicated molecular fingerprint, were developed to predict retention times of steroid structures in any gradient mode conditions. Satisfactory performance was obtained during nested cross-validation with a predictive ability (Q2) of 0.92. The generalisation ability of the model was further confirmed by an average error of 4.4% in external prediction. This allowed the list of candidates associated with identical monoisotopic masses to be strongly reduced, facilitating definitive steroid identification.}

abstract = {A chemometric challenge was proposed during the "Chimiométrie" congress 2016, held in Namur, Belgium, on 17–20 January. The aim of this contest was to challenge the ability of congress participants to build indirect Quantitative Structure-Retention Relationship models (QSRR) using the linear solvent strength (LSS) theory of reversed-phase liquid chromatography. QSRR is a very helpful method for the identification of unknown analytes, including the prediction of chromatographic retention time. Because of the potential presence of various isomeric compounds, accurate retention time prediction is particularly important in the context of steroid identification. In addition, the indirect prediction of retention time using the linear solvent strength (LSS) parameters S and log kW provides a great advantage for use in any gradient conditions. In the proposed dataset, the experimental values of S and log kW were estimated using Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography separation with two linear gradients (5–95% ACN+0.1% FA) of 15 and 60min, respectively. The aim of the challenge was the accurate estimation of retention time for a 45min gradient by applying the LSS theory based on the predicted S and log kW values. Molecular descriptors were calculated from a series of reference steroid compounds using the VolSurf+ software. By these means, a collection of 128 variables related to molecular shape, volume, polarisability, polar surface area, hydrophobic surface area, lipophilicity, molecular diffusion, and solubility was generated automatically. The dataset (n=95) included 76 steroid compounds for calibration and 19 for validation. Experimental log kW, S and retention time values were provided for the calibration set only. The results were evaluated according to the smallest RMSEC obtained for the retention time predictions of the validation set with the 45min gradient using the LSS parameters. Moreover, each individual relative error should not exceed 5% of the experimental retention time for both the calibration and validation sets. This paper summarises the approaches proposed by the best three participants and the challenge organiser.}

abstract = {The development of metabolomics based on ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) now allows hundreds to thousands of metabolites to be simultaneously monitored in biological matrices. In that context, bioinformatics and multivariate data analysis (MVA) play a crucial role in the detection of relevant alteration patterns. However, sound biological interpretations must necessarily be supported by metabolite identifications to be definitive or at least have a high degree of confidence. Each compound, should be characterised by unique molecular properties. Among them, the exact mass and the chromatographic retention time are recognised as major and complementary criteria for compound identification. While the former is easily derived from the molecular structure, building generic and accurate retention time open databases still constitutes a critical issue because of the vast diversity of instruments, stationary phases and operating conditions in UHPLC-HRMS. Because several hits matching a molecular formula obtained from an exact mass and an isotopic pattern are often generated for each analyte, this methodology rarely allows a unique and unambiguous molecular identity to be gained. This work aims to provide a flexible solution to facilitate reliable compound annotation based on retention time in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). It proposes an innovative approach based on the chromatographic linear solvent strength (LSS) theory, allowing retention times under any gradient conditions at fixed temperature, stationary phase and mobile phase type to be predicted. Starting from a subset of the Human Metabolite Database (HMDB), a new dynamic database involving LSS parameters was developed. A real case study involving steroidogenesis alterations due to forskolin exposure was conducted using the adrenal H295R OECD reference cell model for endocrine disruptor screening. The prediction of retention times was successfully achieved, facilitating steroid identification. An automated procedure which implements the compound annotation levels encouraged by the Metabolite Standard Initiative (MSI) and the Coordination of Standards in Metabolomics (COSMOS) was also developed to speed up the process and enhance the data reusability.}

abstract = {Untargeted steroid identification represents a great analytical challenge even when using sophisticated technology such as two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC × GCHRMS) due to the chemical similarity of the analytes. Moreover, when analytical standards, mass spectral and retention index databases are not available, compound annotation is cumbersome. Hence, there is a need for the development of retention time prediction models in order to explore new annotation approaches. In this work, we evaluated the use of several in silico methods for retention time prediction in multidimensional gas chromatography. We use three classical machine learning (CML) algorithms (Partial Least Squares (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR)) and two deep learning approaches (dense neural network (DNN) and three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)). Whereas molecular descriptors were utilized for the CLM and DNN algorithms, three-dimensional molecular representation based on the electrostatic potential (ESP) was studied as input data as is for the CNN. All the developed models showed similar performances with Q2 values over 0.9. However, among all CNN showed the best performance, resulting in average retention time prediction errors of 2% and 6% for the first and second separation dimension, respectively. Additionally, only the three-dimensional ESP representation coupled with CNN was able to extract the stereochemical information crucial for the separation of diastereomers. The combination of retention time prediction and high-resolution mass spectral data applied to clinical samples enabled the untargeted annotation of 12 steroid metabolites in the urine of new-borns.}

Bacterial infections involving joints and vital organs represent a challenging clinical problem because of the two concurrent therapeutic goals of bacterial eradication and tissue preservation. In the case of septic arthritis, permanent destruction of articular cartilage by intense host inflammation is commonly seen even after successful treatment of bacterial infection. Here, we provide scientific evidence of a novel treatment modality that can protect articular cartilage and enhanced eradication of causative bacteria in septic arthritis. Locally delivered cell-penetrating antibiotics such as rifampicin effectively eradicate intracellular reservoirs of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within joint cells. Furthermore, mitigation of intra-articular inflammation by targeting the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich repeat- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome protects articular cartilage from damage in a murine model of knee septic arthritis. Together, concurrent mitigation of intra-articular inflammation and local adjuvant targeting of intracellular bacteria represents a promising new therapeutic strategy for septic arthritis.}

ABSTRACT={Bacterial infection within the synovial joint, commonly known as septic arthritis, remains a clinical challenge as it presents two concurrent therapeutic goals of reducing bacterial burden and preservation of articular cartilage from destructive host inflammation. We hypothesized that mitigation of MRSA-induced inflammatory signaling could diminish destruction of articular cartilage in the setting of septic arthritis when used in conjunction with antibiotics. Herein, we provide evidence which supports a new therapeutic notion that concurrent antimicrobial therapy to address the ‘septic’ component of the disease with inflammation mitigation to manage the destructive ‘arthritis’ component. We established a murine model to mimic septic knee arthritis, as well as a variety of other inflammatory joint conditions. This murine septic arthritis model, in conjunction with in vitro and ex-vivo models, was utilized to characterize the inflammatory profile seen in active septic arthritis, as well as post-antibiotic treatment, via transcriptomic and histologic studies. Finally, we provided the clinical rationale for a novel therapeutic strategy combining enhanced antibiotic treatment with rifampin and adjuvant immunomodulation to inhibit post-infectious, excess chondrolysis and osteolysis. We identified that septic arthritis secondary to MRSA infection in our murine model led to increased articular cartilage damage compared to various types of inflammatory arthritis. The activation of the pERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is implicated with the mounting of an immune response and generation of inflammation, was increased in intracellular MRSA-infected synovial tissue and persisted despite antibiotic treatment. Trametinib, an inhibitor of ERK signaling through suppression of MEK1/2, alleviated the inflammation produced by the addition of intra-articular, heat-killed MRSA. Further, when combined with vancomycin and rifampin, mitigation of inflammation by pERK1/2 targeting improved outcomes for MRSA septic arthritis by conferring chondroprotection to articular cartilage and diminishing inflammatory osteolysis within bone. Our results support a new therapeutic notion that cell/biofilm-penetrating antibiotics alongside adjuvant mitigation of excessive intra-articular inflammation accomplish distinct therapeutic goals: reduction of bacterial burden and preservation of articular cartilage integrity.}
