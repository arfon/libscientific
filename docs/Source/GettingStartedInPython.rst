   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting started in Python
=========================

Every data type object in libscientific is stored in the HEAP and then supports dynamic memory allocation.

In python, there is no need to allocate/deallocate matrix/vectors/tensors and models in general
because the python binding itself automatically handles them.


Use libscientific in python
---------------------------
First, you need to install the c library and the python package.
Please follow the process described `here <http://gmrandazzo.github.io/libscientific/Source/_build/html/Install.html>`_.

A program that use libscientific requires to import the python binding as follows

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import libscientific
   ...


Vector operations
=================

Create a vector in python
-------------------------

There are four different types of vectors

* Double vector: dvector
* Integer vector: ivector
* Unsigned integer vector: uivector
* String vector: strvector


Here we show an example on how create these four vector types.

.. literalinclude:: python_code_examples/vexample1.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:


Append a value to a given vector
--------------------------------

Here we show an example on how to append a value to a vector.

.. literalinclude:: python_code_examples/vexample2.py
  :language: python
  :linenos:



Matrix operations
=================

Matrix is a user-defined data type that contains information in regards to
- the number of rows
- the number of columns
- the 2D data array which defines the matrix

The data array in python uses the c language implementation.
However, memory allocation/destruction is carried out directly from the python class.
Hence there is no need to free up the memory manually.


Create a matrix in python
--------------------------

In this example, we show how to create a matrix from a list of lists (or numpy array),
modify its content and convert it again to a list of lists.

   :language: python

Tensor operations
=================

Multivariate analysis algorithms
================================

In this section, you will find examples of running multivariate analysis algorithms.
In particular, the algorithm described here is extracted from official libscientific publications and is adapted to run in multithreading to speed up the calculation.


* PCA and PLS implements the NIPALS algorithm described in the following publication:

| Partial least-squares regression: a tutorial
| Analytica Chimica Acta Volume 185, 1986, Pages 1â€“17
| DOI:10.1016/0003-2670(86)80028-9



Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
----------------------------------


Here is an example that shows to compute a principal component analysis on a matrix.


.. literalinclude:: python_code_examples/pcaexample1.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:


Partial Least Squares (PLS)
---------------------------

A matrix of features or independent variables and a matrix of targets or dependent variables is requested to calculate a PLS model.

Here is a simple example that shows how to calculate a PLS model.
