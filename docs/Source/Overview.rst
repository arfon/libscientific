What is libscientific?
======================

Libscientific aims to do numerical/multivariate and statistical analysis. The library is written in C language for almost all the computations except for a few methods such as the singular value decomposition (SVD) and the eigenvector/eigenvalue transformation from a third-party library, the Lapack library. It requires two dependencies: CMake and a c/fortran compiler and supports Windows, Linux, macOS, and embedded systems. Python bindings are available using ctypes to avoid dependencies. The library is distributed under GPLv3 license allowing it to be used for public and commercial purposes.

The significant advantage of libscientific is that it does not require dependencies unless a c/fortran compiler and CMake. Moreover, the size of the library is under 1.5MB.
Libscientific also has been tested with old computers.

History
-------

* 2009: Developed and used during my PhD thesis at the Laboratory of chemometrics and cheminformatics at the University of Perugia
* 2016: Open-source the code release under GPLv3. The development still continue under open-source licence


Integration with other open-source projects
-------------------------------------------


* Libscientific is the engine of `QStudioMetrics <https://github.com/gmrandazzo/QStudioMetrics>`_, a software to develop easy multivariate analysis
* `MolecularFramework <https://github.com/gmrandazzo/MolecularFramework>`_ a c/c++ cheminformatic library to analyze 3D molecules and develop process 3D information for model development
